### MsiLib  
A simple C# library for editing the property table in MSI Files

### Requirements
C# 4.0 - Uses dynamic and COM Interop  

Tested on Win7 SP1, Windows Installer 5, YMMV but I imagine it would work back to Win XP


### Status

Currently this library allows the user to Open an MSI via a specified path, Set Properties in the property table, as well as read properties.  Future work will be dependent on needs but I've provided this as a starting point.  I plan on researching usage of this inproc for ASP.NET and utilizing IsolatedStorage
